Music Shop

This was my first ever Music Shop website created using Atom.
I had troubles keeping my account secured as it kept getting deleted but this is my finished product of my website.

## Main Page Of The Website

This is the first page of the website which you can see on the computers/laptop version.

There are 5 options allowing you to select which instrument you would like to check out.

For instance if you want to check out the Electric Guitar, it will take you straight to the Electric Guitar section and so on.

Below is another version of the main page via phones or smaller devices.

Which of course function very well, but navigating with the ham-burtger button at the top left

## css/styles.css

The `css/styles.css` file contains a basic starting template for a responsive page.

## js/scripts.js

The `js/scripts.js` file contains a simple console.log statement to confirm that it is being executed.
