      Bass Guitar, electric bass guitar or what some people would
      like to call it simply bass is a low-pitch instrument. it is
      very similar to an electric guitar except the fact that the bass
      guitar has only the top 4 strings. It is advised that if you
      know how to play an electric guitar, you will know bass guitar
      straight away.

      Guitar is more of the lead of the instrument as it has more notes than
      what the bass guitar has and it is basically also similar to a piano
      the guitar is also used to be playing solos and gives much of a feeling
      when playing and also carries the song from the beginning till the end.

        Piano, almost like a guitar, but except that you are sitting down. It
        also carries the songs as well, but it's more of like a semi leader
        if the electric guitar player is not there to lead the melody, then
        the piano player can lead. It is also fun when trying to change up the
        song of the piano allowing the muscician to play any other instrument.

        The drums is one of the main instruments, more time what people would
        say the easiest. The drum kit gives a beat and keep everyone else on
        time. In addition, the drum kit even helps out to create more of a mood
        to the song as hitting the other parts of the drums creates a nice sound.
        Furthermore, most players that lay drums are mostly people that can
        multi-task as it requires you to move your hands and legs at the same time,
        whilst staying on time with the beat.
